As the head of Engineering, I am fully committed to security, following the OWASP Top 10 guidelines. Firts, I pay close attention to preventing injections, ensuring strong password protection, and managing user sessions properly. Also, I safeguard sensitive data through encryption, control employee access, and thoroughly assess the frontend to prevent XSS issues and make sure to configure Kubernetes on AWS securely, protect our APIs, keep components up-to-date, validate deserialization, and efficiently manage resources. Moreover, I educate all staff on security best practices and consider external audits to maintain the security of our application.
